function qcsf = setupQCSF(maxFrequency,nAFC)
%SETUPQCSF Initializes the quick CSF's structure variable: 
% 
%   qcsf = 
%     stimuli: [1x1 struct]
%     parameters: [1x1 struct]
%
%
% setupQCSF.m sets up the CSF parameter space and grating stimulus space that
% underlie the qCSF method.
% Most of the experimental variables initialized in the setupQCSF.m program are 
% hardware dependent: (1) the range and resolution of grating contrasts
% depend on your monitor's grayscale properties and (2) the range of
% spatial frequencies depends on monitor resolution and viewing
% distance. For that reason, we provide hardcoding of these experimental
% properties, which is only called one time at the start
% of the experiments.
