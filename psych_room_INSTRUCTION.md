### Tumbling E
Using the eye chart in psychophysics room

Testing visual acuity using the 'tumbling E' eye chart

·      Turn on the light at maximum brightness (push the upper side of the light button to increase the brightness).

·      Let the participant sit on a chair at 4 meter distance from the eye chart (see black line on the floor).

·      Make sure eye is patched

·      Flip the eye chart so the participant sees the side with the Es.

·      Start with the upper line and instruct the participant to indicate the orientation of the Es, from left to right.

·      The last line where the participant correctly reports the orientation of at least 3 Es is the maximum visual acuity.

·      Read the visual acuity on the left side of the eye chart ('decimal visual acuity for 4 meter testing distance'), see below for conversion to other visual acuity values. Decimal visual acuity = 1.00 is considered as normal vision.

Repeat this measurement for the other eye.
